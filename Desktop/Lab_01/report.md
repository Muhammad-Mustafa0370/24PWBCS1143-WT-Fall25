# Lab 1 reflection

In this lab, I learned how to create HTML files and add comments.  
I also practiced using Git commands to track changes, create branches, and merge them.  
Adding a .gitignore file taught me how to ignore unnecessary files in Git.  
Finally, I learned how to commit, push, and manage my repository on GitHub.  
This lab helped me understand version control and file management better.
